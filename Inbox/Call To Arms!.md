King [[Sten Stera]] of Steralis has passed away unexpectedly at the age of 28. His heir [[Hans Stera]] is only 6 years old, so advisors and nobles have formed a council to take care of the kingdom until he is of age to take over. However, in the chaos following the unexpected death several insurgent groups have arisen. Normally they would be handled by the local police and militia, however they appear to have acquired a cache of HORUS tech and are proving elusive. In this time of turmoil, we humbly request the aid of any willing to take up arms to restore peace in these troubled times.
