It’s probably fair to think of him as having a rather 1920’s view of fatherhood: a good provider, but authoritarian, distant, and sometimes domineering or callous. Cooper didn’t enjoy the dutiful daughter, but the times she had to do it were infrequent enough, and she had a happy enough childhood mostly staying out of his way. She spent her time exploring the city and slumming with her friends, spending most of her considerable allowance paying various bribes to keep them (and occasionally herself) out of trouble. It would be years before Cooper or her mother understood the full extent of what her father was really doing.What he was doing, basically, was becoming one of the de facto kings of the planet’s underworld.<br>The planet, which I’ve been calling <a data-href=\"Eschaton\" href=\"references/places/eschaton.html\" class=\"internal-link data-link-icon data-link-icon-after data-link-text\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-link-tags=\"#place\" data-link-path=\"References/Places/Eschaton.md\">Eschaton</a> but could be relocated/reflavored, is fairly Earthlike and about a third of the size. It’s what would happen if the Gilded Age took hold somewhere and never really stopped: think 1930’s tech with mass industrialization aided by investment trickling in from Union, with an elite class of oil barons and other captains of industry, whose activities bleed slowly from business ventures into sprawling Chicago mob-style criminal enterprises. Wealth inequality is staggering and graft is even worse, with most of the post-scarcity largesse siphoned off by corporate barons to reinforce their positions. Government is nominally a republic, but it’s so choked that it’s functionally a slightly-rotating oligarchy. It’s quite peripheral, such that having even five mechs on the surface at one time would constitute an extremely busy day. Chrom, with a mech there full-time, found himself uniquely positioned to shop his services around to all sorts of wealthy people in need of some hard power that was both virtually unstoppable and plausibly deniable. The other powers-that-be essentially guaranteed his monopoly: if anyone else had tried to organize the independent ventures that he did, one of the great corporations would swallow them up. But Chrom’s mech was a counterthreat no one with pre-WWII weapons was prepared to meet, at least not for very long. Soon, Chrom was working with groups of people who would never have worked directly with each other, weaving grey- and black- market ventures that spanned a continent.This went on for years, until Cooper was about nineteen, when her father died under mysterious circumstances– he was found unmoving and apparently uninjured in his mech, already cold. It quickly became clear that his death was quite a bit more mysterious than it originally seemed: apparently, Chrom had availed himself of illicit cloning technologies, probably on the say-so of whoever originally sponsored his modifications. There had been more than ten Chroms running around, each one carrying the threat of mech deployment wherever he went. Most of them had families. All of them were involved in different ventures to different degrees, and involved with each other to varying degrees. And, on that March day, all of them dropped dead without warning.&nbsp;The infidelities and new relations were a nasty shock, but nothing compared to the planet-wide fiasco of untangling Chrom’s estate. There was money attached to tons of things, many of which were tied to secrets that could topple half the ruling class (and therefore eagerly pursued by the rest). Much of it was poorly documented or intentionally obscured. It wasn’t even clear if it was correct to treat Chrom as one person. Without much backing, Cooper and her mom walked away with very little, but for one bit of fortune– Cooper was the only child of any Chrom to show signs of Chrom’s own genetic enhancements. So, in exchange for a firm they were likely to lose anyway, what they got were Chrom’s licenses.&nbsp;Since then, Cooper has been trying to unbury herself from the unsavory aspects of her dad’s past. Underneath all the estate divisions, there lurked a murkier world of deals her father had never committed to electronics, kept only in a hand-written notebook she recovered from a compartment in his mech. It was full of favors owed and credited; both were mostly to the kind of people Cooper would have been happy never to meet. It would be fair to call Cooper chaotic good, I think, but her chief motivation is getting clear of that stuff and starting her own life, as a lancer and otherwise: she’s tired of existing in a superposition of “fabulously wealthy” and “probably dead”, and worried that her family might get caught in the crosshairs if she gets complacent. The way she sees it, the more of her family’s old antagonists she can help or charm into being friends, the better off everyone will be– we’re all at least starting from the common ground of being kind of pissed at her dad. Anything that will help Cooper cross something off that list will get her where you need her to be, even if it’s off-planet.&nbsp;A quick word about genetic engineering: I very intentionally didn’t sketch out the details of how Chrom became a lancer or what he was doing for whom. I’m aware this is riding the edge of what Lancer says about cloning, but I figure “Someone tries something on the edge of what’s possible, it works for a while, and then goes badly” is a perfectly fair plot. I do know that the main outward sign of Cooper’s abilities (improved reactions, etc) is her hair, which is mineral-green, grows very slowly, and has the toughness and some of the feel of fiber-optic cable. Her skin can also have a faint green patina in some lights.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":["pc's/humans/cooper-ellys.html","npc-notes/backstory/chrom-ellys.html","npc-notes/backstory/mother-ellys.html","npc-notes/backstory/sister-ellys.html","references/places/eschaton.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"pc's/backstory/cooper-ellys-(backstory).html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1766958244816,"modifiedTime":1766958244816,"sourceSize":6424,"sourcePath":"PC's/Backstory/Cooper Ellys (Backstory).md","exportPath":"pc's/backstory/cooper-ellys-(backstory).html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":28,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"pc's/backstory/evelyn-garve-(backstory).html":{"title":"Evelyn Garve (Backstory)","icon":"","description":"<a data-href=\"Evelyn Garve\" href=\"pc's/humans/evelyn-garve.html\" class=\"internal-link data-link-icon data-link-icon-after data-link-text\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-link-tags=\"#pc\" data-link-path=\"PC's/Humans/Evelyn Garve.md\">Evelyn Garve</a> is about 5'8 and fairly lean muscle.

What she had inherited was his NHP, which she affectionately designated <a data-href=\"Raiju\" href=\"pc's/nhp's/raiju.html\" class=\"internal-link data-link-icon data-link-icon-after data-link-text\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-link-tags=\"#nhp\" data-link-path=\"PC's/NHP's/Raiju.md\">Raiju</a>. Unlike the more common Sisyphus systems, something must have happened either with her tinkering or the late Sulati's last stand. Raiju was not a system you just shut down; in fact, the NHP had taken over the whole of Veda's Pegasus chassis like some amalgamated puppet. Or, at least, that's the rumors. Back Veda into a corner and Raiju would come for you, the Pegasus moving and arming without pilot intervention or action.\nBut those were just rumors, right? Plenty of weird things happened in the dark space between a pilot, their mech, and the NHP networks that behaved like a neural net interface. Plenty of things far weirder than rumors of yet another mech that moved and acted unbidden.(Veda's callsign is Tora. Her father's was one of three: Tora, Tiger, or Raijin)(Veda's dad died likely when she was about 10. She's been piloting since then. Nothing officially on the books until she was 12 or 13 tho)Beyond the hazard lights, the faint sounds of a drumline bounced between the metal walls. It wasn't rock and roll, and it wasn't exactly classical, though it certainly felt more towards the traditional side. A few flashes of light and stray sparks down the bays marked real activity. The bay surrounding the Sulati Pegasus looked less like a parking space and more like the storage unit the crazy uncle would rent to escape his roommates. There wasn't exactly a bed, but the pile of clothes and blankets were pretty indicative of intent. From one hook in the wall a piece of fabric hung down like a canopy, providing a dark spot from the overhead lights. There was even an electric kettle set next to a crockpot and a coffeepot, all over-plugged into an extension cord running into the Pegasus. Tools, all well-used and relatively well-kept but showing their age, were scattered around the area. It wasn't exactly unnerving to see the cockpit and 'head' region of the Pegasus turn towards your approach, though some people experienced a sinking of their stomachs if they'd then saw Veda with a laptop propped in one arm while the other typed standing beside the moving mech. The nineteen year old was dressed in brown, grease-stained overalls, one strap hanging loose with a series of wire cutters and tools peeking out of the various pockets. She did look up when a slight crackling noise somewhere between static and a person tsking boomed from a speaker that had to be tucked behind the Pegasus armor. The sound was chased by a mechanized voice, \"Approaching.\" Veda looked up, surprised to see someone other than one of the techs or stationmasters approaching. \"Y' lost?\"\"Nah.\" The teenage boy walking down the hall grinned, pointing up into the bay to his immediate right. \"Just a neighbor!\" His careworn military jumpsuit clashed slightly with his carefree demeanor; judging from his looks he probably wasn't behind her by more than a year, but he seemed younger anyway. He unslung his backpack taking care to put the omnihook computer terminal he'd been carrying gently against it, along one of the bay's large bulkheads. The bay he pointed to held another Horus frame, a Hydra-pattern whose four arms rested against its body, attached by clamps that wouldn't stand up to close scrutiny or conventional physics. Slithering sounds and odd bulges sometimes came from inside its hunched back, a mark of the pseudosentience that controlled its drones. If the Pegasus had a conscious mind of its own, then Hydra was dreaming. \"I heard they put us down here and had to take a look.\" He noticed the Pegasus eyeing him, and took a single step back before giving it a friendly wave. \"Heey, that's awesome. So, you're really Veda Sulati, huh? Name's Sully, nice to meet you.\"Veda peered into the bay he'd gestured, frowning lightly. \"Must've come in during off hours. Hydra, with drones? You know they originally thought the drones would be used strictly for surveillance - suits always get shit wrong.\" \"-'Nice' is superfluous, state of perceived existence. We have now met.-\" The Pegasus didn't move farther than it had already, though it pulled a laugh from Veda. \"Always to the point, Raiju, fair enough. Yeah, I'm Veda. I do think it's nice to see someone not pissing themselves over tech that shouldn't surprise them.\" She took a few steps towards Sully, extending her hand. \"You're stuck with us on the next job, from the bay assignment?\"\"I didn't know that! Although there are a ton of different ones-- mine's not that tricked out, and there's half a dozen kinds in there. Can see why they'd be tricky to work out.\" Sully laughed along with Veda as he shook her hand. \"Yeah, he's got me there. But I figure, either you guys don't make a habit out of rampaging around mech bays, or somebody doesn't like me very much. And whichever one it is, I'm probably better off on your side.\" \"Yeah, looks that way, if you got on contract yesterday. It sounds like a lot more fun, now that I know I'll get to see you in action.\"\"Drones just feel like a lot to me. I'm impressed with anyone that can handle them, NHP-aided or not.\" She reached out the hand not balancing her laptop, and the Pegasus dipped its 'head' down to touch it gently. \"Cut the taiko down, alright? Don't want to yell over the music.\" \"-Acquiesce.-\" The music - a type of ancient drum pattern from the early days of Earth - faded into the background. \"We're alright on mission. Raiju's rep is just off-the-field. Amazing the number of pilots who are happy to push around a kid and get real nervous when the heat shows up. I was always taught never to take a knife to a gun fight, and I like my guns big and incomprehensible.\" Veda shrugged lightly. \"Sounds like we're in the same gig. And it sounds like an easy one with a desperate client.\" \"-Greater than 82.3% chance of higher than average payout. Stipend terms are credit only. Salvage during mission best course of action for new parts.\" Veda rolled her eyes. \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, you corroded a feeder line when the last gun decided to warp in an acid bath. I already promised it'll get fixed after payout. It's a non-critical component, and you know it. You just want a new toy.\"","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":["pc's/humans/veda-sulati.html","npc-notes/backstory/father-sulati.html","pc's/nhp's/raiju.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"pc's/backstory/veda-sulati-(backstory).html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1766958244816,"modifiedTime":1766958244816,"sourceSize":7031,"sourcePath":"PC's/Backstory/Veda Sulati (Backstory).md","exportPath":"pc's/backstory/veda-sulati-(backstory).html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":30,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"pc's/humans/cooper-ellys.html":{"title":"Cooper Ellys","icon":"","description":"<a data-href=\"Duelist#Tier 2\" href=\"references/talents/duelist.html#Tier 2\" class=\"internal-link data-link-icon data-link-icon-after data-link-text\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-link-tags=\"\" data-link-path=\"References/Talents/Duelist.md\">Duelist &gt;
